  (WIP) ERA5 File Conversion and Query
  <br>
</h1>

ERA5 is the fifth generation of ECMWF atmospheric 
reanalyses of the global climate, and the first reanalysis produced as an operational service. 
It utilizes the best available observation data from satellites and in-situ stations, 
which are assimilated and processed using ECMWF's Integrated Forecast System (IFS) Cycle 41r2.

This project provides tools needed to convert the NetCDF files 
to Apache Parquet files, and querying of the data using AWS S3 Select.
